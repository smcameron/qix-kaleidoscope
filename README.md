qix-kaleidoscope
================

Kaleidoscope-like display made by reflecting and rotating Qix monsters

This is just a little program that makes a kaleidoscope like display by drawing
a bunch of "moving" lines sort of like the old Qix video game, reflecting them
to make things symmetric, then rotating the whole thing around.  The way the
lines are "erased" by re-drawing over them with black lines leaves little bits
still remaining (due to anti-aliasing, I think) and this results in some fairly
interesting patterns.  Written in the Processing language.
